netSys has two builds avaliable.

**netSys Developer Build** and **netSys Embedded Framework.**

# netSys Developer Build

netSys Developer Builds are intended for the testing of applications or early releases of netSys.

netSys Developer Builds are the code directly in the `dev` branch, so they may be prone to glitches or security vulnerabilities.

# netSys Embedded Framework

netSys Embedded Framework, is the main framework of netSys that is **stable** and has been tested to be fully functional.

Although this build is tested, it is **still prone to glitches, bugs, or security vulnerabilities.**

If you find a vulnerability that can cause **severe problems,** it's best to report it priavtely to a verified developer or contributor of netSys.
