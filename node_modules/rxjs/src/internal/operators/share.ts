/**
 * Returns a new Observable that multicasts (shares) the original Observable. As long as there is at least one
 * Subscriber this Observable will be subscribed and emitting data. When all subscribers have unsubscribed it will

 * This is an alias for `multicast(() => new Subject()), refCount()`.
 *
 * ![](share.png)
 *
 * ## Example
 * Generate new multicast Observable from the source Observable value
 * ```ts
 * import { interval } from 'rxjs';
 * import { share, map } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * const source = interval(1000)
 *   .pipe(
 *         map((x: number) => {

 *         share()
 * );
 *
 * source.subscribe(x => console.log('subscription 1: ', x));
 * source.subscribe(x => console.log('subscription 1: ', x));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // Processing:  0
 * // subscription 1:  0
 * // subscription 1:  0
 * // Processing:  1
 * // subscription 1:  1
 * // subscription 1:  1
